- 👋 Hi, I’m @fnando95
- 👀 I’m interested in looking to create new software for future references so anyone can view my development in the programming industry! I love coding and even though I have alot to learn, I will be posting all my creations here for anyone to use :)  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to create a few music programs so my first project will about that! 
- 💞️ I’m currently not looking to collaborate on any projects, but I do look forward to in the future! I would love to grow my abilities, and then if anything comes up, I hope I can be able to provide help on projects!
